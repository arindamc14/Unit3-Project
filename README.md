# Wandering Pets

This is our submission for the 3rd Project for SEI-22

## What is this app?

Wandering Pets is an app that allows users to easily
* report a pet they had just lost
* a wandering animal found in their neighbourhood that might belong to an owner.

## Couldn't you use Facebook or other means?

Yes, there are existing social websites that allow users to posts their pets, while we believe we can make something better.

### Usability

While posts can reach a wide audience at a short amount of time, it cannot be easily searched when buried under other posts.

As an owner who lost a pet, there is no easy way to search for specific breed or color of the pet you lost.

Facebook groups only include lost pets but lack those that were spotted by someone else.

### Privacy

Cons to creating a post is that it is tied to your personal account which you may not want to share your exotic pets to others.

### Spotting

Usually when a non-pet lover sees a collared animal wandering outside, he/she might just carry on their own way and that could've
been a potential rescuer and time could be saved.


### Our Goal

* easy navigation

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
