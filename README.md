# Wandering Pets

This is our submission for the 3rd Project for SEI-22

## What is this app?

Presently, there is no centralised platform for lost and found pets in Singapore. 
The app serves to provide a better lost and found platform for pet owners and users who find pets to communicate.

* Users who find pets need to reach out to a large audience to broadcast the details on the pet that he or she found.

* Owners who lose their pets need a way to share their contact details.

* Organisations that specialise in pet rescue need a way to find owners who might've lost a pet or advertise unwanted pets to new owners

## Couldn't you use Facebook or other means?

Yes, there are existing social websites that allow users to posts their pets, while we believe we can make something better.

### Usability

Facebook has multiple groups where users make posts. This isn’t a great user interface and often has too many posts on the page where matching the lost pet and the owner becomes difficult.

While posts can reach a wide audience at a short amount of time, it cannot be easily searched when buried under other posts.

As an owner who lost a pet, there is no easy way to search for specific breed or color of the pet you lost.

### Privacy

Cons to creating a post is that it is tied to your personal account which you may not want to share your exotic pets to others.

### Spotting

Usually when a non-pet lover sees a collared animal wandering outside, he/she might just carry on their own way and that could've
been a potential rescuer and time could be saved.


## Our Goal

* To make creating a post to be fast and concise
* Posts to contain more relevant information such as contact details, pet description, pet photo, location details
* A better user interface to incentivise users who find pets to use the platform.
* The ability to filter posts by animal type or color
