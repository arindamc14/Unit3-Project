Project Post Mortem

Approach and Process

What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?

1. More iterative process. Focus on 1 aspect, move to the next. Troubleshoot when things are not going right with “puts”.
2. Planning the entire outlook beforehand prior to doing it: for CSS aspects. Results in redoing the codes.
3. Try to finish the basic features earlier so that CSS work has time. 
What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?

1. Generally communication was good
2. Clear division of roles
3. No major conflicts when branches are merged
4. Completing the MVP early on helped us

Code and Code Design

What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?

1. Add live reload for messaging. Currently the user needs to refresh to see if someone has messaged him. There is no notification for messages received either. 
2. Image upload needs validation to reject non jpeg/png files.
3. Link up the pages more sensibly. Some minor features (like “back”) can be improved.
4. We should have created sorting functions to sort pets by pet_type (dogs/cats/birds/rabbits)
5. Location APIs or fixed location categories can be incorporated to provide sorting by location.
6. Clean up some of the codes (eg: emails address must be hidden for privacy)
7. Add user name through another form

What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?

1. CSS animations.
2. Cloudinary config to enable image upload
3. Basic messaging feature
